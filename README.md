# caesars_cipher
Used to decrypt a [rot13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) message. Created this to solve a [freecodecamp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher).

# TODO
- Refactor code
- Add webpage functionality
- add encrypt functionality
- add more than just rot13 maybe add special characters option?
